# About

---

**Myntra was originally a B2B platform for personalized gifts.**

Founded in 2007 by 3 IIT Kanpur alumni; Vineet Saxena, Ashutosh Lawania, and Mukesh Bansal; the platform allowed customers to personalize t-shirts, mousepads, mugs,etc.

**Becoming the launch platform for brands like Being Human & Fastrack**

By 2011, Myntra had moved away from personalization and focused on selling fashion and lifestyle products exclusively. 
Its eclectic collections from over 1000 local and international lifestyle brands made it the preferred choice for the fashion-conscious consumer. 

**Myntra has only grown in scale since then**

30,000+ Orders delivered per day, 1.5 L+ Fashion Products Listed, 18 M Monthly Active Users

# Image Search

---

Myntraâ€™s Image Search feature on its mobile app lets the users search for similar products simply by uploading an image. So now, whenever we find something interesting and fashionable like a shirt, jeans or footwear, click the photo of it, and search it on Myntra using its image search option.

Most of the fashion purchases are done when we see someone using the product and then look for a similar product or sometimes maybe the exact one. This thing cannot be achieved by the simple text search and to overcome it, Myntra introduced the image search. Myntra's Image Search feature on its mobile app lets the users search for similar products simply by uploading an image.
**From clicked image to similar product recommendation**

Deep learning is a subset of Machine Learning which is, in turn, a subset of AI. It is based on artificial neural networks and representation learning. It has a wide range of applications in areas like computer vision, bioinformatics, and board game programs, where the results are comparable to human expert performance, and in some cases even surpassed it.

We will be performing the following three steps:

1. Generate product attributes (features) using an algorithm
2. Using the same algorithm, find attributes of clicked image
3. Find images with attributes similar to clicked image attributes
